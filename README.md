# VSCode Gerrit

Extension for integrating the [gerrit code review tool](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) into VSCode. Allows viewing of Gerrit changes, the file changes they contain and their diffs, as well as commenting on these changes. Also enables you to create and submit new changes, as well as of course ammending existing ones.
